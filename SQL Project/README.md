# SQL Project (Milan)

[In this project](https://github.com/Select-From-Data/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/SQL%20Project), I act as a data analyst for a New York-based moving company. The [**'Exploring'**](https://github.com/Select-From-Data/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/SQL%20Project/Exploring.sql) file contains SQL code I've used to analyze data in various ways to support the company's needs. This work highlights my SQL skills and how SQL can offer insights to help the business.

For the SQL portfolio project I used SSMS (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio) version 19.3.

I made 2 queries, one called ['CreatingMoving'](https://github.com/Select-From-Data/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/SQL%20Project/CreatingMoving.sql) which can be run in SSMS and used to create a database, and 2 tables and insert all data in less than a minute.

The other query is called [**'Exploring'**](https://github.com/Select-From-Data/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/SQL%20Project/Exploring.sql), in that query, you can see some examples of my skills in SQL. 
Skills used: Joins, CTEs, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types, Ranking functions...

I will also upload 2 .csv files. ['Moving'](https://github.com/Select-From-Data/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/SQL%20Project/Moving.csv) and ['MovingInfo'](https://github.com/Select-From-Data/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/SQL%20Project/MovingInfo.csv) in case you find importing data faster/easier than using my first query. Or if you just want to see data.

### Instructions to import data: 
First create a database in SSMS, using a new query and typing: CREATE DATABASE MovingData, and execute that. Then in Object Explorer find your database (refresh Object Explorer if you can't find it) press right-click --> Tasks --> Import data. For Data source choose 'Flat File source', and press 'Browse...' Beside the file name (right bottom corner) choose CSV files, and find files where you saved them. Next --> Next. For Destination, choose 'SQL Server Native Client 11.0' next --> next --> next --> Finish. Your data should be imported. Repeat the whole process for the second table/file. 

When you have all the data imported or created with 1st query, you can start executing my second query. 

*The database is small because I wanted to do the original project with data I made, not just copy something from Kaggle/YouTube.

*I used the help of ChatGPT to generate data.
