For the SQL portfolio project I used SSMS (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio) version 19.3.

I made 2 queries, one called 'CreatingMoving' which can be run in SSMS and used to create a database, and 2 tables and insert all data in less than a minute.

The other query is called 'Exploring', in that query, you can see some examples of my skills in SQL. 
Skills used: Joins, CTEs, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types, Ranking functions...

I will also upload 2 .csv files. 'Moving' and 'MovingInfo' in case you find importing data faster/easier than using my first query.

Instructions to import data:
First create a database in SSMS, using a new query and typing: CREATE DATABASE MovingData, and execute that. Then in Object Explorer find your database (refresh Object Explorer if you can't find it) press right-click --> Tasks --> Import data. For Data source choose 'Flat File source', and press 'Browse...' Beside the file name (right bottom corner) choose CSV files, and find files where you saved them. Next --> Next. For Destination, choose 'SQL Server Native Client 11.0' next --> next --> next --> Finish. Your data should be imported. Repeat the whole process for the second table/file. 

When you have all the data imported or created with 1st query, you can start executing my second query. 

*The database is small because I wanted to do the original project with data I made, not just copy something from Kaggle/YouTube.
*I used the help of ChatGPT to generate data.
